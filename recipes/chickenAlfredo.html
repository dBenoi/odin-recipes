    <p>Olive Garden, you don't stand a chance.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 oz fettucine, broken in half</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice each chicken breast horizontally into 3 thinner pieces using a sharp knife. Sprinkle each chicken
            piece with garlic salt and Italian seasoning on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden and cooked
            through, about 2 minutes per side. Remove onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Add milk and garlic to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and add fettuccine. Cook, stirring every 30 seconds to
            prevent sticking until pasta has softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring every
            couple of minutes, 6 to 7 minutes more. Stir in cream and Parmesan cheese. Simmer, stirring occasionally,
            until sauce has thickened and pasta is cooked, about 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
